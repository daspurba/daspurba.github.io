<h1>About me</h1>

I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Financial Mathematics in the Department of Mathematics at King's College London [(university webpage)](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/purba-das). Before joining KCL, I was a Byrne Research Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the University of Michigan for one year. I completed my DPhil in Mathematical Institute at the University of Oxford under the supervision of [Professor Rama Cont](http://rama.cont.perso.math.cnrs.fr/). I received my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from Chennai Mathematical Institute, India (2016) and my Master's degree in Applied Mathematics from Chennai Mathematical Institute, India (2018). 

My KCL-Pure page is [here](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/purba.das/publications/).



<h1>Research interests</h1>
------
My research interests lie in the fields of stochastic analysis and its applications to mathematical finance. In particular:

Pathwise methods in stochastic analysis: Föllmer-Itô calculus, Functional Itô calculus, Characterising/measuring 'roughness', Invariance of 'rough' integrals.

Roughness in finance: Rough volatility, Microstructure noise, data-driven model discovery, Stochastic symbolic regression.
