    <p style="color: #333; font-size: 16px;">
        I am organizing a conference jointly with <strong>Artur Kotlicki (Bank of England)</strong> on 
        <strong>"Liquidity Stresses and Financial Stability"</strong>. 
        The focus of the conference is stress testing, modeling bank stability in the digital era, 
        and assessing their implications for central bank policies.

<h1>About me</h1>

I am a Lecturer (Assistant professor) in Financial Mathematics in the Department of Mathematics at King's College London. Before KCL, I was a Byrne Research Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the University of Michigan for one year. I completed my DPhil in Mathematical Institute at the University of Oxford under the supervision of [Professor Rama Cont](http://rama.cont.perso.math.cnrs.fr/). I received my Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from Chennai Mathematical Institute, India in 2016 and Master's degree in Applied Mathematics from Chennai Mathematical Institute, India in 2018. 


<h1>Research interests</h1>
------
My research interests lie in the fields of stochastic analysis and its applications to mathematical finance. In particular:

Pathwise methods in stochastic analysis: F√∂llmer-It√¥ calculus,  'roughness' of functions.

Roughness in finance: Rough volatility, Microstructure noise.
